<!-- The revision numbering system for GNOME manuals is as follows: -->

<!-- * the first component of the revision number reflects the release version of the GNOME desktop. -->
<!-- * the second component of the revision number is a decimal unit that is incremented with each revision of the manual. -->
<!-- For example, if the GNOME desktop release is V2.x, the first version of the manual that -->
<!-- is written in that desktop timeframe is V2.0, the second version of the manual is V2.1, etc. -->
<!-- When the desktop release version changes to V3.x, the revision number of the manual changes -->
<!-- to V3.0, and so on. -->

    size of a basic installation of &app; small and to reduce the amount of resources 
    necessary to run &app;.</para>

      automatically be created. To create a new document while you already have a document
      opened in &app;, choose <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>New</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>.</para>

      </guimenuitem></menuchoice> or click the <guibutton>Open</guibutton> button in the toolbar
      to display the <guilabel>Open File</guilabel> dialog. Select the file that you want to open,
      then click <guibutton>Open</guibutton>. If you open a document in the file manager and &app; 
      is associated with that type of document, &app; will be started automatically.</para>

      on the toolbar to display the list of recent files.</para>

    <!-- ================ Saving Documents ================================ -->
    <sect2 id="abiword-savingdocuments"> 
      <title>Saving Documents</title> 
      <para>There are three options for saving a document: <guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem>, 
      <guimenuitem>Save As...</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Save Copy...</guimenuitem></para>
      <para>If you want to save a document for the first time, choose <menuchoice><guimenu>
      File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save As...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to display the <guilabel>
      Save File As</guilabel> dialog. Even if you choose another option to save the document 
      from the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu, you will always be given the <guilabel>Save File 
      As</guilabel> dialog if you save the document for the first time. Give the document you
      want to save a name, and optionally specify where you want to save it and in which file
      format, then click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. You can also use <guimenuitem>Save As...

      <para><menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
      is used to save the changes you made to an existing document. <menuchoice><guimenu>
      File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save Copy...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> is used to save a copy
      of an existing document under the same name. If you choose to use <guimenuitem>
      Save Copy...</guimenuitem>, you will probably have to change the location where you want
      the file to be saved, because you can't save two documents with the same name in one
      directory.</para>

    <sect2 id="abiword-templates"> 
      <title>Using Templates</title> 
      <para>Templates are documents with missing information which are used to produce a finished
      document. Templates can be useful because they allow you to produce a finished document faster
      than if you were creating a new document from scratch. Templates already contain a modified 
      layout and placeholder text, so you fill in your own text in the template and save it as a 
      normal document.</para>
      <para>A few templates are already included in &app;, you can access them by choosing
      <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>New using Template...</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>. You can create your own templates by creating a document and then saving it as
      an AbiWord Template.</para>
      <tip>
        <para>To make your own templates appear in the <guimenuitem>New using Template...</guimenuitem>
        dialog, you can place your templates in the templates directory. The location of this directory
        is <filename class="directory">%USERPROFILE%\AbiSuite\templates</filename> on Windows, 
        <filename class="directory">/usr/share/AbiSuite-2.4/templates</filename> on Unix and Linux and

      to the right (under the condition that you are using a language which is read from left to right). The
      <keycap>Space Bar</keycap> is used to create empty spaces between words, and <keycap>Return</keycap>

        <para>By default only an English dictionary for the spelling checker is delivered with &app;. If you

      respectively at least a single character or an entire paragraph. Under <guilabel>Based On</guilabel>
      you can select an existing style on which the (new) style will be based. The new or modified style will
      then take the properties of the style it is based on, but it is still possible to modify the style
      completely. By default <guilabel>None</guilabel> is selected for new styles. Under <guilabel>Style for
      the following paragraph</guilabel> you can select a different style to be used for the next paragraph,
      but you can also continue to use the current style if you select <guilabel>Current Settings</guilabel>.
      Under <guilabel>Remove Property from Style</guilabel> you can remove properties from the style, which
      means that a default will be used for that property then.</para>
      <para>Click <guibutton>Format</guibutton> in <guilabel>New Style</guilabel> or <guilabel>Modify 
      Styles</guilabel> dialog for access to options which allow for detailed modification of the style. The
      options which are accessible under this button are <guilabel>Paragraph</guilabel>, <guilabel>Font
      </guilabel>, <guilabel>Tabs</guilabel>, <guilabel>Numbering</guilabel> and <guilabel>Language</guilabel>
      the dialogs for these options are identical to the dialogs discussed in the previous chapters covering
      paragraphs, fonts, tabs and numbering. The option <guilabel>Language</guilabel> is the only exception,
      it allows you to mark certain paragraphs as using a different language, so that they will be properly
      checked by the spelling checker.</para>

      of measurement: inches, centimeters, points and pica's. To change the unit of measurement used by the 
      ruler, choose <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Preferences...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and
      change the unit of measurement with the <guilabel>Units</guilabel> drop down box.</para>
      <para>The ruler has more functions. With the ruler you can change the page margins and the indents of 
      paragraphs. You can also set tab stops on the ruler to align text.</para>

      <para>The margins of the page are indicated by grey areas on the left and right ends of the ruler. You can see
      two small squares near the top of the ruler, near the ends of the margins. To change the margins, drag the
      the squares to the left or right.</para>
      <para>You can change the indentation of paragraphs with the three triangles located on the horizontal ruler.
      The triangle near the top left on the ruler is used for setting the indentation of the first line of a paragraph
      only. The triangle near the bottom left on the ruler is used for setting the indentation of all the lines in 
      the paragraph, except for the first line. The triangle near the bottom right on the ruler is used to set the
      indentation to the right side of the paragraph, for all lines of the paragraph.</para>

    <title>Alternatives for setting the margins, indentations and tab stops</title>
      <para>If you want to be able to define the page margins and the dimensions of your document more precisely, 
      you can do so with <guilabel>Page Setup</guilabel> which is accessible through <menuchoice><guimenu>File
      </guimenu><guimenuitem>Page Setup...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. You can also change the indentation and tab 
      stops for paragraphs by choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>Format</guimenu><guimenuitem>Paragraph...</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>.</para>
    </tip>
      <para>With tab stops you can change the alignment of text. There are five different types of tab stops, by 
      default the left tab stop is visible in the tab stop selector. You can select different tab stops by clicking 
      on the tab stop selector. Once you have selected the tab stop which you want to use, click on a place in the 
      horizontal ruler to place the tab stop there. To move a tab stop which was already placed, click and drag it. 
      To remove a tab stop, right click it.</para>
      <para>When you have placed a tab stop in the ruler, you can jump to that tab stop by pressing the Tab key on 
      your keyboard. If you do not use the Tab key to jump to the tab stops and simply type paragraphs as you would
      normally, the tab stops will not work.</para>

      <para>With the <guilabel>Max Column Size</guilabel> you can specify the maximum vertical length of the 
      columns. By default it is zero, which means that the column will end at the bottom margin of the page. If 
      a value higher than zero is specified, you can change the lenght of the vertical gaps between the columns
      with the <guilabel>Space after Column</guilabel> setting. The <guilabel>Line between</guilabel> option can
      be enabled to display a vertical line between the horizontal gaps of the columns, and the <guilabel>Use 
      RTL Order</guilabel> option can be used to display the columns from right to left.</para>
      <para>The width of the horizontal gaps between the columns can only be changed with the ruler. The
