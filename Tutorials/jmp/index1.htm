	<h3>Welcome to the AbiWord Help!</h3>
	
	<p>
	Abiword is a free word processing program similar to Microsoft Word, 
	provided by SourceGear Corporation.  In AbiWord Help, you'll learn how to use AbiWord to type 
	 specific kinds of documents. 
	Our intention is to show you, the user, how to learn the main functions of AbiWord through
	task-oriented tutorials.   </p>
	
	<p>We've arranged the tutorials into three main types of 
	tasks: a letter, a resume, and a party invitation.
	Below you will find an overview of what functions you will learn in each 
	tutorial.</p>
	
<ul>
	<li>Tutorial 1, you will be writing a letter which focuses on the 
	fundamentals of using AbiWord. In this tutorial you'll
	learn basic functions such as how to: create a new document, 
	open and close a document, save and print a document, word count,
	insert the date and time, number pages, and
	check for spelling errors.</p>
	
	<li>Tutorial 2, you will be writing a resume which focuses on key
	functions such as:  copying and pasting text, 	find and replace words, changing font style 
	using the tool      bar, find and replace text, and inserting bullets and numbering.</p>
