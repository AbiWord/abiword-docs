ways to start a letter is to begin with to whom you are 
typing your letter to. Below you will see an example from a student typing a
letter to a professor. </p>

<p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>

<p>Dear Professor Harrison,</p>

<p>I am writing a resume and I would like to include a letter of recommendation 
from you for my diligent effort and hardwork in your class. I will be applying for a technical writing position with a Marketing Consulting Firm in New York. I can give you all the 
necessary information at a later date. Please let me know if you're willing to 
give me a letter of recommendation, for potential employer's. 
I plan on also having this letter on my personal website as well. 
Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p> Jessica </p>

or ignore all, add or cancel"</strong>.</p>

<p>If at any point during your spell check you decide to
exit the spell check function simply choose the <strong>"Cancel"</strong>

<div class="right">
<p><img src="images/pagenu1.gif" alt="pagenu1.gif"></p>

to your letter.</p>

<p> Numbering pages is important if you have more than one page to your
document, also having a time and date on your letter can be helpful as well.</p>

<p> Select the <strong>"OK"</strong> button.</p>

<div class="right">
<p><img src="images/date2.gif" alt="date2.gif"></p>
</div>

choose displayed on your letter.
