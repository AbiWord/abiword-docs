<h3>Inserting a HyperText link</h3>
<p>The zoom control is a tool that allows the user to position the screen to a more comfortable or
customized state.  By choosizing a large percentage size, you can zoom in towards the work area.  If a smaller size is choosen, the work area becomes incresingly "farther away," allowing more to be seen on the screen at once, but in less detail.<p>

<p>In the event that you wish to use insert a text hyperlink, perform the following actions.
<ul>
<li>Select a place inside your typed text.  Select menu "Insert," then select "bookmark."  The text you have highlighted is now a "jump-to" spot called a bookmark.

<li> Next, select another string of text that will contain your "jump-link."  Once highlighted, choose menu "Insert", then choose "hyperlink."  Select you previously entered bookmark, and press "OK."   
<li>  You have now created a   hyperlink and its associated bookmark.  When this link is double-clicked, AbiWord will automatically jump to the bookmark that is linked to the hyperlink.
