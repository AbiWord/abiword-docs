<h1>Welcome to AbiWord's tutorial for writing a letter</h1>    
<p>In addition to creating a letter, this tutorial will help you become
familiar with some of the functions of AbiWord. Before you begin this 
writing process you need to decided who you will be writing your letter
to. Once you have determined who you are going to write your letter to 
you are ready to jump into the task-orientated part of writing your letter.

<h2>Task 1</h2>

<p>Select <a href="#" onClick=window.open("File_drop.html","Zoom","width=700,height=500")>"File"</a> 
and from the drop down menu Select new.<br /></p>

by placing  your mouse pointer in the circle and clicking.<br /></p>
	
<p>Select "OK" to open your new document.<br /></p>
	
<h2>Task 2</h2>

ways to start writing your letter is to begin with addressing
to whom you are writing your letter to. 
<p> For Example: 

<p> Dear Mr. Rogers.

<p> Then continue on in the writing of your letter.

<h2>Task 3</h2>
<p>Once you have finished your letter you may or may not wish to "Save" the
document. In order to "Save" your document select the
<a href="#" onClick=window.open("Saveas_doc.html","Zoom","width=800,height=700")>"Save as"</a> 
icon from the tool bar.

letter and saved it you are ready to use the spell check function to 
search for misspelled words.
