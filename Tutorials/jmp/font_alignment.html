<h1>Text Justification</h1>
<p>
Highlight all text on the page by pressing "Ctrl+A" on your keyboard: Mac users press
"Apple"+"A". 
Once all the text is highlighted, align the text as you see fit:
<p>
<img src="images/justificationblowup.jpg" width="342" height="231" alt="" border="0">
<p>
The center alignemnt icon is the one that has the text represented as vertically symetrical.  
The other icons in this group move the text as their icon faces display. 
<p>
Your choices are as follows: left justification, ceneter justification, right justification, and full justification.
Once your text has been highlighted, press your appropriate justification setting and the highlighted test will adjust
accordingly.  
<p>
Eaxample:
 Click on the "center justification" icon, and you will see your text centered like so:<p>
<img src="images/invite-cntr-text.jpg" width="294" height="490" alt="" border="0">

<br/>

You can adjust this as many times as needed.
