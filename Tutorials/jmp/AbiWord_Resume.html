<h1>AbiWord's Resume Tutorial</h1>

<p>Welcome to AbiWord's tutorial for writing a Resume. With this tutorial we will
  help you to create a Resume, and will also help you to become familiar with
  the functions associated with AbiWord. We will do this by using a task oriented
  style that focuses on you, the student/casual user. This tutorial expands on
  the previous section of "Writing a Letter", so if you are not familiar with
  <a href="newdoc.html"> opening a new document</a>,&nbsp; please select the link and review
  the task.</p>
</br>

<p>As mentioned above, you will perform some of the same functions that were taught
  in "Writing a Letter". To avoid redundancy, we will not cover those tasks in
  this tutorial. What we will focus on is cut, copy and pasting, using bullets
  and numbering, changing the font, and finding and replacing text. You
  may select the following links to view these functions, or you may follow along
  in the Resume to get more in depth instruction. </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#copy">Cut,Copy, and Pasting</a></li>
  <li><a href="#bullets">Using bullets and numbering</a></li>
  <li><a href="#fonts">Changing Fonts</a> </li>
  <li><a href="#find">Find and replace text</a></li>
</ul>
	
<p>Start creating your Resume by opening a new document.</p>

<p>Create a heading by typing  your name, address, telephone number, and email, if applicable.&nbsp;If you have this
information on your computer you can just cut, copy, and paste the information into your document.&nbsp;To do this
just follow the instructions below.
<a name="copy"></a>
<h2>Cut, Copy, and Paste</h2>
<ul>
	<li>To cut the information you will first have
to highlight the text. Do this by holding down your left mouse button and dragging it over
the text you wish to relocate. Look for the icon of the scissors on the tool bar, and click on them.
This will cut the text, or make it disappear.
 <div class="img">
<p><img src="images/Cut.bmp" width="75" height="75" border="0" alt="cut">
</div>
	<li>To copy the text follow the instructions above, but  this time select the copy icon.
	<div class="img">
<p><img src= "images/Copy.bmp" width="75" height="75" border="0" alt="copy">
</div>
	<li>Navigate back to AbiWord. Place the cursor in the section of the document where you want to locate the text,
	and select the paste icon.
	<div class="img">
<p><img src= "images/Paste.bmp" width="75" height="75" border="0" alt="paste">
</div>
</ul>
<a name="bullets"></a>
<h2>Using Bullets and Numbers</h2>
<p>Now is an opportune time to show you how to create bullets.  To create bullets in your Resume following the instructions below.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click on Format from the tool bar.  And, from the drop down menu select bullets and numbering.</li>
	<div class="img">
<p><img src="images/Format.bmp" name="format.bmp" width="234" height="274" border="0" ></p>
 </div>
	<li>Next, you will see the screen below.  Click the types box and select bullets.</li>
	<div class="img">
<p><img src="images/bullets.bmp" name="bullets" width="503" height="431" border="0"></p>
</div>
	<li>If you would like to change styles, select the styles box and choose one.</li>
	<li>Choose apply and close. You have just created bullets in your document.</li>
</ul>
<p>To use numbers instead of bullets do the following.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Select Format from the menu bar.</li>
	<li>Select numbers from the type box.</li>
	<li>Change the style of numbers by clicking on the style box and changing the style.</li>
	<li>Click "apply" and then "ok"</li>
</ul>


<p>Next, you will want to create an objectives section.&nbsp;  This section states the reason why you have written
 your Resume.&nbsp;You will follow this section with several pertinent topics.&nbsp;
 Some examples are Education, Related Experience, and Work History to name a few.  To make your Resume
 look visually appealling you should work with different fonts.</p>
 <a name="fonts"></a>
 <h2>Changing Fonts</h2>


<p>You should use different fonts for headings and body text in your Resume. For
  example, use sans serif fonts for headings and serif fonts for text in the body
  of your document. To change the fonts in your Resume do the following.</p>
 <ul>
 	<li>Locate the font menu on the tool bar.  You will see the box below.</li>
	<div class="img">
<p><img src="images/Fonts.bmp" width="177" height="27" border="0"></p>
</div>
	<li>Click the arrow beside the font to see a list of fonts.</li>
	<li>Select a font by clicking one.</li>
	<li>If needed, change the font size by clicking on the arrow next to the number.</li>
	<li>Select a number.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are ready to continue creating your Resume with a different font.</p><a name="find"></a>

<h2>Find and replace text</h2>
<p>Use the Find and Replace functions  to help you find a
specific word or phrase within your document. Or, you can replace a word with
a new word.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Find a specific word in your document by clicking on "Edit" from the tool bar.</li>
    <li> Select  "Find" in the drop down list.  You will see the image below.</li>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/find.bmp" width="387" height="108" alt="" border="0">
</div>

	<li>Type in the word you are looking for, and then click the
	   "Find Next" button.  The word you are looking for will be
	    highlighted in gray.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "Replace" function will replace a word in your document.</p>
<ul>
	
  <li>Replace text by selecting "Edit", and from the drop down list, select "Replace".</li>
	<li>You will see the image below</li>
	<li>Type a word in the "find what:" box.
