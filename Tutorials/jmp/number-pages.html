<h1>Numbering Pages</h1>


<p>If you have more than one page and you want to number your pages. Then
pay attention because this step will teach you how to do just that.<p>

<p>Select <strong>"Insert"</strong> from the menu.</p>

<div class="right">
<p><img src="images/pagenu1.gif" alt="pagenu1.gif"></p>
</div>

<p>Select <strong>"Page Number"</strong> from the drop down list.</p>

<p>Note: In this box you can adjust where you want the page number to show
up on your document.</p>

<p> Open the drop down box underneath the
word <strong>"Position"</strong>.
<p>Select either<strong> "Header" (top) or "Footer" (bottom)</strong>
</p> 

<p>Select <strong>"Alignment"</strong> to adjust where you want the page number to be located on your page.</p>
<p> Select <strong>"Right","Left" or "Center"</strong>, this will place the page number in one of the three areas.</p>

<p>Be sure to <strong> "Preview</strong> the page before you select OK.</p> 

<div class="right">
<p><img src="images/pagenu2.gif" alt="pagenu2.gif"></p>
</div>

<p>Select the <strong>"OK"</strong> button.</p>

<p>Nowq you will notice page numbers on your document. 
However if at anytime during the process of numbering your pages
you want to exit this function click the <strong>"Cancel"</strong> button to go 
back to your document and no page number will be assigned 
to your letter.</p>

<p> Numbering pages is important if you have more than one page to your
document, also having a time and date on your letter can be helpful as well.</p>
