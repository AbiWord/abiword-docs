<h3>Zoom Control</h3>
<p>The zoom control is a tool that allows the user to position the screen to a more comfortable or
customized state.  By choosizing a large percentage size, you can zoom in towards the work area.  If a smaller size is choosen, the work area becomes incresingly "farther away," allowing more to be seen on the screen at once, but in less detail.<p>


<img src="images/zoom.jpg" width="296" height="184" alt="" border="0">
<br />

<p>Choose an approprite percentage from the drop down box.  Zooming in or out from a document will not change any of the documents contents.
