<h1>Find and Replace</h1>

<p>The Find and Replace features can save you a great deal of time, which makes it a valuable editing tool.  These feature do all the work for you so you don't have to skim the whole document looking for and replacing words.  It also prevents missing any words which can happen during skimming.</p>

<h2>Find</h2>

<p>The Find function enables you to search throughout a file for occurrences of a specified word or character.</p>
<p>Let's search for a specific word in your document by following these three easy steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Open the document you created in Lesson 1
	<li>Select <span class="menu">Edit</span> from the Menu bar
	<li>Select <span class="menu">Find</span>
	<p class="note">The <span class="dialog">Find</span> dialog appears.</p>
	<li>Type a word you would like to find in the Find What window 
	<li>Select <span class="button">Find Next</span>
	<p class="note">The program searches the entire document for the designated word and highlights each occurence in your document.</p>
	<p class="note"><span class="bold">Note:</span> You can also search for a word by select the CTRL+f keys at the same time.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Replace</h2>
<p>The Replace feature works directly with the Find feature.  The Replace function allows you to automatically substitute a word or character for another word or character throughout your document.</p>

<p>Let's search and replace a specific word in your document by following these few basic steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Select <span class="menu">Edit</span> from the Menu bar
	<li>Select <span class="menu">Replace</span> 
	<p class="note">The <span class="dialog">Replace</span> dialog appears.</p>
	<li>Type a word you would like to replace in the document in the Find what window 
	<li>Type the word you would like to use as a replacement for the original word in the Replace with window
	<li>Select <span class="button">Replace</span> or <span class="button">Replace All</span>
	<p class="note">The program searches the entire document for the designated word and automatically replaces each word with your replacement word.</p>
	<p class="note"><span class="bold">Note:</span> You can also replace a word by pressing the Ctrl and h keys at the same time.</p>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations!  You have just completed all sections of Lesson 3 and can now setup your page, format your fonts, set tabs, insert page breaks, and search and replace words or characters in your document.  If you would like to move on to Lesson 4 and learn how to enhance your document, select Next.  If you'd like to go to a different section within this lesson or to a new lesson, choose from one of the options in the Navigation bar.</p>
