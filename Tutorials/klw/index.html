	<h1>Welcome to the AbiWord Tutorial!</h1>

	<p>By using SourceGear Corporation's free word processing program, AbiWord, you'll be able to do many of the same functions as you would using Microsoft Word without the expense, such as typing papers, letters, reports, memos, and so forth.  To get you started with using AbiWord, we're providing you with a tutorial that is designed to introduce you to the basic operations and functions of AbiWord.  The six lessons include practice exercises to work through as well as examples for creating documents in your work.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><span class="bold">Lesson 1</span> focuses on the fundamentals of AbiWord.  It covers starting AbiWord; creating new documents; saving, closing and opening documents; checking for spelling errors; and printing.</p>
		<li><span class="bold">Lesson 2</span> addresses formatting options, such as aligning and formatting text; copying, cutting, and pasting text; and undoing and redoing an action.</p>
		<li><span class="bold">Lesson 3</span> covers more editing options, including setting page features, formatting fonts, setting tabs, inserting page breaks; and using the Find and Replace features.</p>
		<li><span class="bold">Lesson 4</span> introduces features that help you enhance your documents, such as headers and footers, lists, and symbols; and inserting page numbers and pictures.</p>
		<li><span class="bold">Lesson 5</span> focuses on applying styles from creating a new style; applying a different style; modifying a style; and deleting a style.</p>
		<li><span class="bold">Lesson 6</span> addresses some of the more advanced features of AbiWord such as applying subscript/superscript to text; inserting bookmarks; and creating hyperlinks.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Let's get started with Lesson 1!</p>
